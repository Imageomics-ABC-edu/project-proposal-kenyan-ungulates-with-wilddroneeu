  volume={197},
  ISSN={0924-2716},
  DOI={10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.01.025},
  abstractNote={Rapid growth of human populations in sub-Saharan Africa has led to a simultaneous increase in the number of livestock, often leading to conflicts of use with wildlife in protected areas. To minimize these conflicts, and to meet both communities’ and conservation goals, it is therefore essential to monitor livestock density and their land use. This is usually done by conducting aerial surveys during which aerial images are taken for later counting. Although this approach appears to reduce counting bias, the manual processing of images is time-consuming. The use of dense convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has emerged as a very promising avenue for processing such datasets. However, typical CNN architectures have detection limits for dense herds and close-by animals. To tackle this problem, this study introduces a new point-based CNN architecture, HerdNet, inspired by crowd counting. It was optimized on challenging oblique aerial images containing herds of camels (Camelus dromedarius), donkeys (Equus asinus), sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra hircus), acquired over heterogeneous arid landscapes of the Ennedi reserve (Chad). This approach was compared to an anchor-based architecture, Faster-RCNN, and a density-based, adapted version of DLA-34 that is typically used in crowd counting. HerdNet achieved a global F1 score of 73.6 % on 24 megapixels images, with a root mean square error of 9.8 animals and at a processing speed of 3.6 s, outperforming the two baselines in terms of localization, counting and speed. It showed better proximity-invariant precision while maintaining equivalent recall to that of Faster-RCNN, thus demonstrating that it is the most suitable approach for detecting and counting large mammals at close range. The only limitation of HerdNet was the slightly weaker identification of species, with an average confusion rate approximately 4 % higher than that of Faster-RCNN. This study provides a new CNN architecture that could be used to develop an automatic livestock counting tool in aerial imagery. The reduced image analysis time could motivate more frequent flights, thus allowing a much finer monitoring of livestock and their land use.},

    abstractNote={High-resolution monitoring is fundamental to understand ecosystems dynamics in an era of global change and biodiversity declines. While real-time and automated monitoring of abiotic components has been possible for some time, monitoring biotic components—for example, individual behaviours and traits, and species abundance and distribution—is far more challenging. Recent technological advancements offer potential solutions to achieve this through: (i) increasingly affordable high-throughput recording hardware, which can collect rich multidimensional data, and (ii) increasingly accessible artificial intelligence approaches, which can extract ecological knowledge from large datasets. However, automating the monitoring of facets of ecological communities via such technologies has primarily been achieved at low spatiotemporal resolutions within limited steps of the monitoring workflow. Here, we review existing technologies for data recording and processing that enable automated monitoring of ecological communities. We then present novel frameworks that combine such technologies, forming fully automated pipelines to detect, track, classify and count multiple species, and record behavioural and morphological traits, at resolutions which have previously been impossible to achieve. Based on these rapidly developing technologies, we illustrate a solution to one of the greatest challenges in ecology: the ability to rapidly generate high-resolution, multidimensional and standardised data across complex ecologies.}, number={12},

    abstractNote={Mobile animal groups provide some of the most compelling examples of self-organization in the natural world. While field observations of songbird flocks wheeling in the sky or anchovy schools fleeing from predators have inspired considerable interest in the mechanics of collective motion, the challenge of simultaneously monitoring multiple animals in the field has historically limited our capacity to study collective behaviour of wild animal groups with precision. However, recent technological advancements now present exciting opportunities to overcome many of these limitations. Here we review existing methods used to collect data on the movements and interactions of multiple animals in a natural setting. We then survey emerging technologies that are poised to revolutionize the study of collective animal behaviour by extending the spatial and temporal scales of inquiry, increasing data volume and quality, and expediting the post-processing of raw data.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Collective movement ecology’.},

    abstractNote={Methods for collecting animal behaviour data in natural environments, such as direct observation and biologging, are typically limited in spatiotemporal resolution, the number of animals that can be observed and information about animals’ social and physical environments. Video imagery can capture rich information about animals and their environments, but image-based approaches are often impractical due to the challenges of processing large and complex multi-image datasets and transforming resulting data, such as animals’ locations, into geographical coordinates. We demonstrate a new system for studying behaviour in the wild that uses drone-recorded videos and computer vision approaches to automatically track the location and body posture of free-roaming animals in georeferenced coordinates with high spatiotemporal resolution embedded in contemporaneous 3D landscape models of the surrounding area. We provide two worked examples in which we apply this approach to videos of gelada monkeys and multiple species of group-living African ungulates. We demonstrate how to track multiple animals simultaneously, classify individuals by species and age–sex class, estimate individuals’ body postures (poses) and extract environmental features, including topography of the landscape and animal trails. By quantifying animal movement and posture while reconstructing a detailed 3D model of the landscape, our approach opens the door to studying the sensory ecology and decision-making of animals within their natural physical and social environments.},

    abstractNote={This study investigated the accuracy of animal identification based on herd behaviour from drone camera footage. We evaluated object detection algorithms and point pattern analysis, using footage from drone altitudes ranging from 15 m to 130 m. We applied transfer learning to state-of-the-art lightweight object detection algorithms (Tensorflow and YOLO) based on feature extraction. In the point pattern analysis, we treated each animal as a point and identified them by the behavioural pattern of those points. The five animal species investigated were African elephant (Loxodonta africana), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) and zebra (Equus quaggas). As we increased the altitude of the drone camera, the detection algorithms using features significantly lost accuracy. Animal features are harder to detect at higher altitudes and in the presence of environmental camouflage, animal occlusion, and shadows. The performance of lightweight object detection algorithms (F1 score) decreased with increasing drone altitude to a minimum of 29%, while the point pattern algorithms produced an F1 score above 96% across all drone altitudes. Using point pattern analysis, the accuracy of animal identification is invariant to drone camera altitude and disturbances from environmental conditions. Animal social interactions within herds follow speciesspecific hidden patterns in their group structure that allow for reliable species identification.}, journal={Ecological Informatics},

    abstractNote={In the last decade, drones have become an affordable technology offering highly mobile aerial platforms that can carry a range of sensory equipment into hitherto uncharted areas. Drones have thus become a widely applicable tool for surveying animal populations and habitats to assist conservation efforts or to study the behavioural ecology of species by monitoring individual and group behaviour. Here, we review current applications for drone surveys and the potential of recently developed computer algorithms for automatic species detection and individual tracking in drone footage. We further review which factors are reportedly associated with animal disturbance during drone presentations and how drones may be used to study anti-predator behaviour. Drone surveys of species and their environments allow scientists to create digital terrain models of habitats, estimate species abundance, monitor individual behaviour and study the composition, spatial organization and movement of groups. As drones can influence the behaviour of many bird and mammal species directly, they also provide an experimental tool to study animal responses to novel situations, including the drone itself. We conclude that the combined use of drones and automated detection software can assist population estimates and opens new possibilities to study individual and collective behaviour. With regard to drone-related disturbance and their potential use as predator models, we recommend to interpret results against the background of population-specific predation pressure and sources of anthropogenic disturbance.},

            Inexpensive and accessible sensors are accelerating data acquisition in animal ecology. These technologies hold great potential for large-scale ecological understanding, but are limited by current processing approaches which inefficiently distill data into relevant information. We argue that animal ecologists can capitalize on large datasets generated by modern sensors by combining machine learning approaches with domain knowledge. Incorporating machine learning into ecological workflows could improve inputs for ecological models and lead to integrated hybrid modeling tools. This approach will require close interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the quality of novel approaches and train a new generation of data scientists in ecology and conservation.},

    DOI={10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.12.005},
    abstractNote={In many areas of animal behaviour research, improvements in our ability to collect large and detailed data sets are outstripping our ability to analyse them. These diverse, complex and often high-dimensional data sets exhibit nonlinear dependencies and unknown interactions across multiple variables, and may fail to conform to the assumptions of many classical statistical methods. The field of machine learning provides methodologies that are ideally suited to the task of extracting knowledge from these data. In this review, we aim to introduce animal behaviourists unfamiliar with machine learning (ML) to the promise of these techniques for the analysis of complex behavioural data. We start by describing the rationale behind ML and review a number of animal behaviour studies where ML has been successfully deployed. The ML framework is then introduced by presenting several unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Following this overview, we illustrate key ML approaches by developing data analytical pipelines for three different case studies that exemplify the types of behavioural and ecological questions ML can address. The first uses a large number of spectral and morphological characteristics that describe the appearance of pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, eggs to assign them to putative clutches. The second takes a continuous data stream of feeder visits from PIT (passive integrated transponder)-tagged jackdaws, Corvus monedula, and extracts foraging events from it, which permits the construction of social networks. Our final example uses aerial images to train a classifier that detects the presence of wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, to count individuals in a population. With the advent of cheaper sensing and tracking technologies an unprecedented amount of data on animal behaviour is becoming available. We believe that ML will play a central role in translating these data into scientific knowledge and become a useful addition to the animal behaviourist’s analytical toolkit.}, journal={Animal Behaviour},

    abstractNote={This article reviews studies regarding wild animal surveys based on multiple platforms, including satellites, manned aircraft, and unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), and focuses on the data used, animal detection methods, and their accuracies. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of each type of remote sensing data and highlight some new research opportunities and challenges. Submeter very-high-resolution (VHR) spaceborne imagery has potential in modeling the population dynamics of large (>0.6 m) wild animals at large spatial and temporal scales, but has difficulty discerning small (<0.6 m) animals at the species level, although high-resolution commercial satellites, such as WorldView-3 and -4, have been able to collect images with a ground resolution of up to 0.31 m in panchromatic mode. This situation will not change unless the satellite image resolution is greatly improved in the future. Manned aerial surveys have long been employed to capture the centimeter-scale images required for animal censuses over large areas. However, such aerial surveys are costly to implement in small areas and can cause significant disturbances to wild animals because of their noise. In contrast, UAS surveys are seen as a safe, convenient and less expensive alternative to ground-based and conventional manned aerial surveys, but most UASs can cover only small areas. The proposed use of UAS imagery in combination with VHR satellite imagery would produce critical population data for large wild animal species and colonies over large areas. The development of software systems for automatically producing image mosaics and recognizing wild animals will further improve survey efficiency.}, number={1111}, journal={Remote Sensing}, publisherOptional={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Wang, Dongliang and Shao, Quanqin and Yue, Huanyin},

We explored possible solutions include the selection of sample annotation methods, optimizing positive or negative samples, using weakly and self-supervised learning methods, selecting or developing more suitable network structures.

    abstractNote={Animal movement datasets are growing in number and depth, and researchers require a growing number of analytical approaches to adequately answer questions using movement datasets. As the complexity of questions and analyses increase, deciding on the best approach both in terms of study design and analysis can become more difficult. A potential solution is to simulate an array of synthetic datasets under varying study designs and simulation parametrisations to gain insight into the impact of analysis choice(s) in different contexts. The abmAnimalMovement R package provides the means of simulating animal movement for this purpose. The abmAnimalMovement simulations use a discrete time agent-based model and does not require previous movement data as an input. The simulations include a number of key internal and external movement influences, as well as parameters for navigation and mobility capacity of the animal. Internal influences include three predefined behavioural states (e.g., rest, explore, forage) and any number of activity cycles (e.g., diel, seasonal). External influences are implemented via matrices describing landscape characteristics (e.g., shelter quality, foraging resources, movement ease), and predefined points describing shelter sites and points the animal aims to avoid. Navigation capacity is defined by the range the animal can dynamically choose a foraging location to which it is subsequently attracted. Mobility capacity is implemented by user defined distributions, from which step length and turn angles are draw at each time step, governing the possible subsequent locations of the animal. Critically, the navigation capacity (the choice of destination) operates on a different time scale to the mobility capacity, allowing the internal state of the animal to differ from the observed movements. When combined with other emergent properties, such as site fidelity generated via repeated shelter site use, the simulations offer opportunities to test whether movement analyses can accurately recover hidden mechanisms, states, and drivers.},

    abstractNote={An automatic, quick, accurate, and scalable method for animal behavior inference using only videos of animals offers unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological phenomena and answer challenging ecological questions. The advent of sophisticated machine learning techniques now allows the development and implementation of such a method. However, apart from developing a network model that infers animal behavior from video inputs, the key challenge is to obtain sufficient labeled (annotated) data to successfully train that network - a laborious task that needs to be repeated for every species and/or animal system. Here, we propose solutions for both problems, i) a novel methodology for rapidly generating large amounts of annotated data of animals from videos and ii) using it to reliably train deep neural network models to infer the different behavioral states of every animal in each frame of the video. Our method’s workflow is bootstrapped with a relatively small amount of manually-labeled video frames. We develop and implement this novel method by building upon the open-source tool Smarter-LabelMe, leveraging deep convolutional visual detection and tracking in combination with our behavior inference model to quickly produce large amounts of reliable training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on aerial videos of plains and Grévy’s Zebras (Equus quagga and Equus grevyi). We fully open-source the code1 of our method as well as provide large amounts of accurately-annotated video datasets2 of zebra behavior using our method. A video abstract of this paper is available here3.},

  abstractNote={Ecosystems function in a series of feedback loops that can change or maintain vegetation structure. Vegetation structure influences the ecological niche space available to animals, shaping many aspects of behaviour and reproduction. In turn, animals perform ecological functions that shape vegetation structure. However, most studies concerning three-dimensional vegetation structure and animal ecology consider only a single direction of this relationship. Here, we review these separate lines of research and integrate them into a unified concept that describes a feedback mechanism. We also show how remote sensing and animal tracking technologies are now available at the global scale to describe feedback loops and their consequences for ecosystem functioning. An improved understanding of how animals interact with vegetation structure in feedback loops is needed to conserve ecosystems that face major disruptions in response to climate and land-use change.},

 abstractNote={It is a challenging and meaningful task to carry out UAV-based livestock monitoring in high-altitude (more than 4500 m on average) and cold regions (annual average – 4 °C) on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The purpose of artificial intelligence (AI) is to execute automated tasks and to solve practical problems in actual applications by combining the software technology with the hardware carrier to create integrated advanced devices. Only in this way, the maximum value of AI could be realized. In this paper, a real-time tracking system with dynamic target tracking ability is proposed. It is developed based on the tracking-by-detection architecture using YOLOv7 and Deep SORT algorithms for target detection and tracking, respectively. In response to the problems encountered in the tracking process of complex and dense scenes, our work (1) Uses optical flow to compensate the Kalman filter, to solve the problem of mismatch between the target bounding box predicted by the Kalman filter (KF) and the input when the target detection in the current frame is complex, thereby improving the prediction accuracy; (2) Using a low confidence trajectory filtering method to reduce false positive trajectories generated by Deep SORT, thereby mitigating the impact of unreliable detection on target tracking. (3) A visual servo controller has been designed for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to reduce the impact of rapid movement on tracking and ensure that the target is always within the field of view of the UAV camera, thereby achieving automatic tracking tasks. Finally, the system was tested using Tibetan yaks on the Qinghai Tibet Plateau as tracking targets, and the results showed that the system has real-time multi tracking ability and ideal visual servo effect in complex and dense scenes.},

    title={Integrating Biological Data into Autonomous Remote Sensing Systems for In Situ Imageomics: A Case Study for Kenyan Animal Behavior Sensing with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)},
    abstractNote={In situ imageomics leverages machine learning techniques to infer biological traits from images collected in the field, or in situ, to study individuals organisms, groups of wildlife, and whole ecosystems. Such datasets provide real-time social and environmental context to inferred biological traits, which can enable new, data-driven conservation and ecosystem management. The development of machine learning techniques to extract biological traits from images are impeded by the volume and quality data required to train these models. Autonomous, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are well suited to collect in situ imageomics data as they can traverse remote terrain quickly to collect large volumes of data with greater consistency and reliability compared to manually piloted UAV missions. However, little guidance exists on optimizing autonomous UAV missions for the purposes of remote sensing for conservation and biodiversity monitoring. The UAV video dataset curated by KABR: In-Situ Dataset for Kenyan Animal Behavior Recognition from Drone Videos (Kholiavchenko et al. 2024) required three weeks to collect, a time-consuming and expensive endeavor. Our analysis of KABR revealed that a third of the videos gathered were unusable for the purposes of inferring wildlife behavior. We analyzed the flight telemetry data from portions of UAV videos that were usable for inferring wildlife behavior, and demonstrate how these insights can be integrated into an autonomous remote sensing system to track wildlife in real time. Our autonomous remote sensing system optimizes the UAV’s actions to increase the yield of usable data, and matches the flight path of an expert pilot with an 87% accuracy rate, representing an 18.2% improvement in accuracy over previously proposed methods.},

    abstractNote={Animal movement datasets are growing in number and depth, and researchers require a growing number of analytical approaches to adequately answer questions using movement datasets. As the complexity of questions and analyses increase, deciding on the best approach both in terms of study design and analysis can become more difficult. A potential solution is to simulate an array of synthetic datasets under varying study designs and simulation parametrisations to gain insight into the impact of analysis choice(s) in different contexts. The abmAnimalMovement R package provides the means of simulating animal movement for this purpose. The abmAnimalMovement simulations use a discrete time agent-based model and does not require previous movement data as an input. The simulations include a number of key internal and external movement influences, as well as parameters for navigation and mobility capacity of the animal. Internal influences include three predefined behavioural states (e.g., rest, explore, forage) and any number of activity cycles (e.g., diel, seasonal). External influences are implemented via matrices describing landscape characteristics (e.g., shelter quality, foraging resources, movement ease), and predefined points describing shelter sites and points the animal aims to avoid. Navigation capacity is defined by the range the animal can dynamically choose a foraging location to which it is subsequently attracted. Mobility capacity is implemented by user defined distributions, from which step length and turn angles are draw at each time step, governing the possible subsequent locations of the animal. Critically, the navigation capacity (the choice of destination) operates on a different time scale to the mobility capacity, allowing the internal state of the animal to differ from the observed movements. When combined with other emergent properties, such as site fidelity generated via repeated shelter site use, the simulations offer opportunities to test whether movement analyses can accurately recover hidden mechanisms, states, and drivers.}, number={11:1182}, publisher={F1000Research}, author={Marshall, Benjamin Michael and Duthie, Alexander Bradley},
